Hi, first of all: thank you for downloading OpenWavParser.
I'm sure it will make your developer's life easier.

Before start with the test application, please extract the example WAV files from "ExtractMeToStreamingAssets.zip" to the persistent
data path (the path is printed to the console when the test scene starts) so you can access them from the test application.

This test scene doesn't access StreamingAssets directly, if you need that feature please check FileManagement in the AssetStore:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/67183

Please take a look at the documentation, it's short and clear.

Thanks again.
