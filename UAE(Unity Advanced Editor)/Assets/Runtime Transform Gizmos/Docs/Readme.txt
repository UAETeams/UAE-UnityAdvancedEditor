Welcome to Runtime Transform Gizmos!
------------------------------------------

Get started with:
API Docs: https://rtg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Video Tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i2m550eFyg&list=PLPwpt1oIEdwAY_Qo6fczi6qTiUjCMZBW1

Tutorial files can be found in Assets/Runtime Transform Gizmos/Scripting Tutorials.

Note: Starting with version 2.0, 2 other assets have been merged with RTG (Runtime Collider & Light Gizmos and Runtime Terrain Gizmos).
	  In the Docs folder, you can find 2 additional pdf files: 
		- RCLG Doc - documentation for Runtime Collider & Light Gizmos;
		- RTRG Doc - documentation for Runtime Terrain Gizmos;
	  These docs contain a chapter that talks about plugin initialization. This can be ignored since the 2 packages are
	  now part of Runtime Transform Gizmos. Essentially, these 2 docs should only be used to gather information directly
	  related to creating and working with collider/light/terrain gizmos. Everything else can be ignored.

Enjoy!
